# Codex Prompt

Guidelines for keeping ERPNext extensions consistent:

- **App location**: place each app under `apps/<appname>`.
- **Required content**: every app should provide a README and a DocType `<appname>_Globals`.
- **Documentation**: consult the notes in `instructions/` for ERPNext specifics.
- **Integration**: ERPNext itself is provided by the surrounding Frappe template.
