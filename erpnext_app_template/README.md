# ERPNext App Template

**Important:** This template complements the Frappe app template. It contains only ERPNext specific instructions so it can be used as a submodule. See `DEV_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for automation details.

## TL;DR â€“ Using Codex

1. **Clone this repo** or include it as a submodule of your Frappe based project.
2. **Optional template repos** go into `template-repos.txt`.
3. The file `vendor-repos.txt` lists required framework apps. It already
   includes ERPNext so the Frappe template clones it automatically.
4. **Sample data** can be placed in `sample_data/`.
5. **Commit and push** your customised repository.

Trigger the **Update Vendor Apps** workflow in the Frappe template (or run `./setup.sh` there) to clone ERPNext and generate `codex.json`. Afterwards create a Codex environment and start developing your extensions.

This repository serves as a starting point for custom **ERPNext** modules. Frappe itself is provided by the main template.
