# Vendor Management

This document explains how vendor repositories are integrated into your app via submodules.

## Files

- `vendors.txt` – lists common vendor slugs. Each line refers to a vendor profile under `instructions/vendor_profiles/`.
- `custom_vendors.json` – allows you to specify additional repositories or override those from the profiles.
- `apps.json` – generated by `update_vendors.sh`; records the exact repository, branch or tag and commit of each installed vendor.

## Script: `update_vendors.sh`

The script reads both `vendors.txt` and `custom_vendors.json`, resolves the repository URL and ref from the vendor profiles and clones every entry as a submodule under the `vendor/` directory. When a vendor repository is private, provide a `GITHUB_TOKEN` or `API_KEY` via `.env` or `.config/github_api.json` so the script can authenticate.

Submodules removed from the lists are deleted, and the updated state is written back to `apps.json`.

## GitHub Workflow

`update-vendors.yml` triggers this script automatically whenever `vendors.txt` or `custom_vendors.json` change. The workflow commits updated submodules and documentation back to the repository.
